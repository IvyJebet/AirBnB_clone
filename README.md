# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Overview
This project aims to create a simplified clone of the AirBnB website, focusing on key features and concepts of higher-level programming. The application consists of a backend built with Python, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, serialization/deserialization with JSON, and a command-line interface (CLI) frontend.

## Features
- Command-line interface (CLI) for managing AirBnB objects and operations.
- Backend implemented with Python, following OOP design principles.
- Serialization and deserialization of Python objects to JSON format for data persistence.
- Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on AirBnB objects like users, properties, reservations, etc.
- Unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the application's functionality.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following main components:

- **Backend:** Contains Python classes representing AirBnB objects, along with methods for data manipulation and serialization/deserialization.
- **CLI:** Utilizes the `cmd` module in Python to create a command-line interface for user interaction.
- **Serialization:** Handles the conversion of Python objects to JSON format for storage and retrieval.
- **Tests:** Includes unit tests to verify the functionality of backend classes and CLI commands.
